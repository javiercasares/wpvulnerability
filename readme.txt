== Description ==

This plugin integrates with the WPVulnerability API to provide real-time vulnerability assessments for your WordPress core, plugins, themes, PHP version, Apache HTTPD, and nginx. It delivers detailed reports directly within your WordPress dashboard, helping you stay aware of potential security risks. Configure the plugin to send periodic notifications about your site's security status, ensuring you remain informed without being overwhelmed. Designed for ease of use, it supports proactive security measures without storing or retrieving any personal data from your site.

= Data reliability =

The information provided by the information database comes from different sources that have been reviewed by third parties. There is no liability of any kind for the information. Act at your own risk.

== Using the plugin ==

= WP-CLI =

You can use the following WP-CLI commands to manage and check vulnerabilities:

* `wp wpvulnerability core`: Lists Core vulnerabilities.
* `wp wpvulnerability plugins`: Lists Plugins vulnerabilities.
* `wp wpvulnerability themes`: Lists Themes vulnerabilities.
* `wp wpvulnerability php`: Lists PHP vulnerabilities.
* `wp wpvulnerability apache`: Lists Apache HTTPD vulnerabilities.
* `wp wpvulnerability nginx`: Lists nginx vulnerabilities.

All commands support the `--format` option to specify the output format:

* `--format=table`: Displays the results in a table format (default).
* `--format=json`: Displays the results in JSON format.

Need help?

* `wp wpvulnerability --help`: Displays help information for WPVulnerability commands.
* `wp wpvulnerability [command] --help`: Displays help information for a WPVulnerability command.

= REST API =

The WPVulnerability plugin provides several REST API endpoints to fetch vulnerability information for different components of your WordPress site.

* `/wpvulnerability/v1/core`: Fetches Core vulnerabilities.
* `/wpvulnerability/v1/plugins`: Fetches Plugins vulnerabilities.
* `/wpvulnerability/v1/themes`: Fetches Themes vulnerabilities.
* `/wpvulnerability/v1/php`: Fetches PHP vulnerabilities.
* `/wpvulnerability/v1/apache`: Fetches Apache HTTPD vulnerabilities.
* `/wpvulnerability/v1/nginx`: Fetches nginx vulnerabilities.

Authentication

The WPVulnerability REST API uses Application Passwords for authentication. You need to include a valid Application Password in the Authorization header of your requests.

Example Request with Authentication

```
curl -X GET https://example.com/wp-json/wpvulnerability/v1/plugins -u username:application_password
```

Replace username with your WordPress `username` and `application_password` with your [Application Password](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/05/application-passwords-integration-guide/).
